<p align="justify">
<br>This Utter Masterpiece&trade; is a loving homage to the late Flappy Bird mobile app game..................</br>
But what if instead of Flappy Bird, we played as DEATH RIDING A SCYTHE?!
And what if instead of wings flapping, it was Death's flatulence propelling you forward?!
WHAT IF Death travelled from a Graveyard, through the River Styx, and into the fiery depths of Hell?!?!
WONDER NO MORE! Death Farts is here to quell all those curiosities!

## :bulb: IPS :bulb:
- What do we use for our obstacles?
    - Lantern Staff in three different colors, one for each of our backgrounds.

- How do we implement a seamless side scrolling background?
    - Mirror your image and save it as a separate file.
    - Double the width of your canvas size on your OG image, shift OG image to the left.
    - Place your mirrored image on the right side of the canvas. Voila!

  <img src="RM_imgs/RM_4.png" alt="RM_4" width="40%">
</p>


- How can we easily make our three backgrounds blend together better?
    - Add clouds to the top of each background image to help create an illusion of seamless blending

</p>

- How do we implement a Leader Board?
    - Use a .txt file for local machine scorekeeping.

  <img src="RM_imgs/RM_imgLB2.png" alt="LB2" width="30%">
</p>


- How do we delay the obstacles in the beginning so you don't immediately crash?
    - Add a function to the gameplay screen
    - Have to tap once on `Spacebar` for the game to start.


- How do we implement the farts?!
    - Use the same image but in three different colors, one for each background.
    - Use pygame.transform.scale() & pygame.Surface
        - Increases the size of the farts while they fade away

</p>


- Why does the game look like everything's moving weird?
    - The base and lanterns need to move at the same speed. No more motion sickness!


- Why does tapping on the Game Over Screen register on the Main Menu Screen?
    - Need to clear the input buffer
    - Use pygame.event.clear()
        - `LMB` no longer registers on the Game Over Screen


- Why does the fart placement look a little off?
    - Needed to lower the placement of the fart
        - Makes the fart flow look much more natural

## :robot: Future Functionalities :robot:
- Super charged fart
- Make intermediate images so the backgrounds fully transition and blend into each other
- Have Death squint when he farts
- Have multiple difficulty levels (perhaps a Fury Mode?)
- Have Death fart & fly by on the Main Menu Screen
- Have the Main Menu Screen scroll into the actual gameplay
- Have Death squint, fart, & fly by on the Game Over Screen
